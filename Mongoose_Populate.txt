Just Like Join in SQL we have Mongoose Populate in the Mongoose database


StudentSchema

name : String
age : Number
course : REF (ObjectID)


CourseSchema

id:1 (StudentSchema id)
name:mongodb
hours:40


With Query Populate all the feild of CourseSchema linked with the course of StudentSchema

{
    objectID:1427272,
    name:"John",
    age:12,
    course:{
        objectID:1427,
        name:mongodb,
        hours:40
    }
}
